# Handwriting Recognition with TensorFlow

## About

This project take place as a milestone of my self study of CNNs. To create this web application I used as base [this course on TensorFlow JS by google](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-classfication/index.html?index=..%2F..index#4).

I added some comment and improvement to the example of the course to test what I learned. It's the first official project on this subject, I will personnaly made more of them to improve my knowledge.
The MNIST is a pretty basic and conventionnal CNN but it's a good way to start and learn. The goal here is to focus on the train part.
